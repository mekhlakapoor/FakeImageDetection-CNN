This study is a deep learning approach to classify images as either forged (fake) or pristine (original, not manipulated). 
The purpose of this study is to create a convolutional neural network that can recognize different types of manipulations on an image with an optimal accuracy of 90%. Some of these manipulations include plain white/black patches, filtered patches, and GAN-generated images.
